# hiv-typing-proj

This repository is used to track the planning and development of the HIV drug resistance testing project. Stockholm and Gothenburg are developing an automated pipeline for HIV drug resistance testing. Currently, Karolinska University Hospital and Sahlgrenska University Hospital perform this test manually using the [Stanford HIVDB](https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/). This process depends on internet access and raises data security concerns.
